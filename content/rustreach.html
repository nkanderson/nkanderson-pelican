  Was one of 12 participants selected to work with Rust core team members to improve Rust development tools and resources.
  Focus of project work has been on rustw, a web frontend for the Rust compiler built with React & Redux. To date,
  improvements have been made to the development experience, adding API documentation and tools like JSON server, as well
  as the end user experience, with URL routing and a cleaner layout.
