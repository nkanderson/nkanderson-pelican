    Worked on full site redesign, contributing on multiple levels of the codebase from custom Drupal modules to
    front-end styling. Since the launch in September 2015, additional projects included setting up end-to-end and visual
    regression testing using Nightwatch and Wraith, creating custom workflows with the Mailchimp API, and improving
    measurement of site metrics through Google Analytics and Tag Manager. Beyond regular maintenance and feature
    additions, developed multiple stand-alone, interactive experiences in single-page application style to facilitate
    deeper user engagement.
