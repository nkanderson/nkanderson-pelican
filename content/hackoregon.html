    Met weekly with team over two project seasons to create a data product exploring urban development in Portland.
    First season contribution centered on the front-end javascript used to aggregate data from microservices and create
    an animated map using Leaflet. During the second season, main contributions were to the ETL pipeline, using Python
    and the Pandas library to prepare data from Zillow before it was loaded into a PostgreSQL database.
